🎮 Predictive OS Resource Allocation

A GUI-based Operating Systems project that predicts process behavior to optimize CPU, memory, and system resource allocation. Developed as part of a university Operating Systems course, this project combines theoretical concepts with practical application.

🔍 Project Overview

This project simulates a smart OS-level resource allocator that:

* Predicts future process behavior
* Intelligently assigns CPU, memory, and other resources
* Improves overall system efficiency
* Visualizes the process queue and system usage in a GUI

It serves as an interactive way to explore OS concepts, predictive algorithms, and GUI programming.

🛠️ Features
🧠 Prediction Logic: Anticipates future resource needs based on historical data.
🎛️ Dynamic Allocation: Adjusts resources on-the-fly to improve efficiency.
📊 GUI Dashboard: Visual interface displaying process queue, CPU usage, memory distribution, etc.
⚙️ Simulation Mode: Run custom process sets and observe performance in real-time.

💻 Technologies Used

1. Python 3.x
2. Tkinter (GUI)
3. Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for graphs)
4. Standard libraries: threading, time, random

Each module is separated for clarity and easy testing.

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/anishk-neuroforge/predictive_os_allocator.git
cd predictive_os_allocator

2. Install required libraries (if not already installed):
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
python3 main.py

🔮 Future Improvements

* Add ML-based prediction (e.g., linear regression)
* Simulate IO-bound vs CPU-bound processes more accurately
* Add logs and analytics dashboard
* Export results to CSV/PDF

✨ About

This project is a playful yet educational OS simulator:

It forecasts CPU, memory, and I/O demands, allocates resources proactively, reduces bottlenecks, and boosts system efficiency — all while letting you see it live in a GUI.
